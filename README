This document outlines what each of the submitted files do.  But really,
as soon as you type 'q' to stop viewing this document, the software will
build itself and run all tests.


Files:
~~~~~

 * message.cpp
 * message.h
These files implement the message object itself.  See message.h for API documentation.


 * Makefile
Useful targets are:
 - make			# builds everything, links with test scaffolding and runs all tests
			# Note: This also produces gcov output.  You can then go: 'cat message.cpp.gcov'
			# to see which lines of source code were executed during testing.

 - make clean   	# remove everything but source code and makefile


These files:
 * crbUnit.cpp
 * crbUnit.h
are my unit-testing library which allow for isolated testing of individual functions.  
Test functions are given a seperate process so that if they crash, the parent thread can do a 
post-mortem analysis and report what happened elegantly.  
That way, one failure doesn't halt all testing and it is easier to teack down why crashes occur and
which tests cause them.

 * main.cpp
This is the test scaffolding which uses the crbUnit library to run tests on individual functions.
