These files:
 * message.cpp
 * message.h
implement the message object itself.  This is my source code submitted for grading.


 * Makefile
Useful targets are:
 - make			# builds everything, links with test scaffolding and runs all tests
			# Note: This also produces gcov output.  You can then go: 'cat message.cpp.gcov'
			# to see which lines of source code were executed during testing.

 - make clean   	# remove everything but source code and makefile


These files:
 * crbUnit.cpp
 * crbUnit.h
are my unit-testing library which allow for isolated testing of individual functions.

 * main.cpp
This is the test scaffolding which uses the crbUnit library to run tests on individual functions.
