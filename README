Assignment: 3


This document outlines what each of the submitted files do.  If you type 'make', 
the software will build itself and run all tests.  The test executable is assignment3/test.


Files:
~~~~~

 * message.cpp
 * message.h
These files implement the message object itself.  See message.h for API 
documentation.


 * Makefile
Useful targets are:
 - make			# builds everything, links with test scaffolding 
			# and runs all tests
			# Note: This also produces gcov output files
			# to see which lines of source code were executed 
			# during testing.  These are then analysed and 
			# summarized by the make gcov target.  
			# these gcov files are then deleted by the 
			# make clean_gcov target because they are annoying 
			# to have lying around.  

 - make clean   	# remove everything but source code, makefile and docs


These files:
 * crbUnit.cpp
 * crbUnit.h
are my unit-testing library which allow for isolated testing of individual 
functions. Test functions are given a seperate process so that if they 
crash, the parent thread can do a post-mortem analysis and report what 
happened elegantly.  That way, one failure doesn't halt all testing and 
it is easier to teack down why crashes occur and which tests cause them.

 * main.cpp
This is the test scaffolding which uses the crbUnit library to run tests 
on individual functions.
